**About the project**

The idea of this project is to be a sandbox. This repository is the parent, where I bring together several micro-projects in the form of microservices, which communicate with each other. The proposal is to have a place where I can practice new learning in a large project, simulating a business project.
It is important to note that I will be giving up complex modeling or modeling that makes more sense in order to have focus and time on architecture. So everything here is over-architecting.
